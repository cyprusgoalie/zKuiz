## Description

Blockchain technologies and zero-knowledge proofs could fundamentally impact multiple sectors of everyday life, including education. Currently, educational applications of blockchain, like on-chain testing, is still in its infancy, but there is room to grow! zKuiz is a small "proof of concept" project to implement on-chain quizes, with privacy secured by the "moon math" of zero-knowledge proofs. zKuiz was developed as a final project for ZKU's cohort 3.
