# zKuiz: On-chain quizzes secured by zero-knowledge proofs

This project is being developed as a final project for Zero-Knowledge University Cohort 3. This project has been forked from ChubbyChub's survey-on-chain-hh back-end implementation for the Ninja Survey project.

zKuiz allows for a specific user (the teacher) to construct a quiz out of questions with pre-defined answers (e.g. multiple choice questions).
